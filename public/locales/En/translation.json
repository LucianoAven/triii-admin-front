    "title1": "Can I make mass mailings via the Chat API?",
    "subtitle1": "We encourage our customers not to send unwanted messages and not to make bulk marketing messages. Otherwise your account can be blocked by the WhatsApp anti-spam system. Do not send more than 6000 messages per day from one number. Or no more than 5-10 messages per minute. Exceeding this threshold may attract the attention of WhatsApp algorithms. To send more messages, connect another number",
    "title2": "I need to send more than 6,000 messages a day. What to do?",
    "subtitle2": "Use multiple accounts. Multiple numbers of WhatsApp allow you to send more messages per day. If you use more than 5 accounts, we provide a discount. Accounts are added on request to technical support.",
    "title3": "Can I send images, audio and video files?",
    "subtitle3": "Yes, you can. Important! Use the / sendFile method instead of the message (sendMessage) method in the link to the token. Send only https links (do not send http). The maximum file size is 60 mb. It is better to send large files with a link, not base64.",
    "title4": "How do I send a message to the WhatsApp group?",
    "subtitle4_1": "Create a group using the POST / group method.",
    "subtitle4_2": "Get chatid through the GET / messages method.",
    "subtitle4_3": "Send a message to the group via POST / sendMessage.",
    "title5": "Will Chat API be updated when I update WhatsApp?",
    "subtitle5": "Yes, it will be updated. Chat API has been working and supported since December 2015. Usually there are 3 - 4 updates per year, affecting the work of the Chat API. Within 1 working day, we adapt the API to the changes.",
    "title6": "Is the status 'Delivered' and 'Read' displayed when sent via the Chat API?",
    "subtitle6": "Yes. See the section 'ack' in the documentation",
    "title7": "How to connect WhatsApp to Chat API?",
    "subtitle7_1": "How to connect WhatsApp to Chat-Api",
    "subtitle7_2": "Connect the phone number to the service.",
    "subtitle7_3_1": "Create your Chat-Api account. It's free!",
    "subtitle7_3_2": "After that you will be redirected to the admin panel where your personal instance (account) will be created. You will receive a QR code on the main page of your personal account. Pay attention to secure authorization for new phones. Now, following the instructions, open WhatsApp on your mobile phone, go to «Settings» - > WhatsApp Web - > Scan QR code",
    "subtitle7_4_1": "What do you need to get started?",
    "subtitle7_4_2": "A mobile phone with WhatsApp running is required for normal operation. Most of the time, our customers simply plug an unused WhatsApp device into the power grid and do not use it for any other purpose It is important to observe the conditions for correct functioning of the bots: - The WhatsApp app is running on your device (not in power saving mode), connected to the internet and has a good battery life. - Do not use Whatsapp Web! Please do not sign in to the WhatsApp web version after you have connected your number to your personal account, this will result in a connection reset and you will have to go through the connection procedure again. In case of violation of any of these conditions, the messages will stop reaching your personal cabinet and will not be sent.",

    "title9": "Our advice. Safety and Blocking",
    "subtitle9_1": "Security and blockages",
    "subtitle9_2": "The main reason WhatsApp can block a number is because of user complaints about spam. Just a few clicks on the 'This is spam' button after you send your messages. You will not be able to unlock your phone number. You will not be able to get your customers' answers. You will lose your subscriber base and you will have to activate a new phone number (we do not charge you any additional fees).",
    "subtitle9_3": "If you are banned, please contact our technical support team.",
    "subtitle9_4": "How to avoid blocking?",
    "subtitle9_5": "Our marketing recommendations:",
    "subtitle9_6": "- Set up the advertising in such a way that the user is the first to write to you (the 'Mark as Spam' button does not appear).",
    "subtitle9_7": "- Send messages only to your loyal database of numbers that have given you their consent.",
    "subtitle9_8": "- Don't send the same messages, change them: personalize the messages (“Hi, %name%”).",
    "subtitle9_9": "- Take advantage of the opportunity to subscribe and unsubscribe from your mailing list in each message. To do this, add reply buttons (e.g. 'Write 0 to unsubscribe')",
    "subtitle9_10": "- Minimize the presence of a link in messages at first use of the bot",
    "subtitle9_11": "- Offer users to save your contact",
    "subtitle9_12": "Our technical recommendations:",
    "subtitle9_13": "- New phone numbers have a greater risk of being blocked. Before connecting a completely new number, we advise you to use Whatsapp personally for some time (chat with other numbers so that you have a variety of incoming and outgoing messages from different numbers)",
    "subtitle9_14": "- Use secure authentication in your personal account",
    "subtitle9_15": "- When you start using the bot, send no more than 5-10 messages per minute, i.e. send messages in batches, not all at once. The longer your bot works, the more messages you can send.",
    "subtitle9_16": "- Do not use numbers and devices(!) that have already been blocked by WhatsApp."
